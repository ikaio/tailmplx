# ![OpenTO](.github/opento.svg)
An open-source platform for sharing torrents. The main motivation for this project is to bullet-proof the emerging technologies its built on top of, it's a playground or a brain-storming project to reveal hidden nitpicky caveats that a project may encounter as it grows using this stack, helping to define the best structure to new projects based on issues this project may find. It's also a lesson project for me as I just got into the language. I'm aware this will eventually be used in a legal compliance violated way, but I chose this subject because it requires multi-thread logic, caching and data optimization, which is what I'm trying to catch on.

# Getting it running
- By running `./tidy.sh` it will check if you have all necessary CLI tools installed, and if so, install all dependencies.
- After that, you can just use `air` to run with hot-reload.
